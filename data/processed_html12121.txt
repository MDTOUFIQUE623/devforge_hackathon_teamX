- MD TOUFIQUE MD TOUFIQUE • You You Artificial Intelligence Enthusiast || Building AI Solutions for business Artificial Intelligence Enthusiast || Building AI Solutions for business 4mo • 4 months ago • Visible to anyone on or off LinkedIn Missed calls are silent killers for local businesses. I asked a local plumber how he handles them. He said: "By the time I call them back, they've already found someone else." That line hit me hard. Because it’s not just a missed call. It’s a missed job. A missed customer. And a missed paycheck. So I built something to fix it. A dead-simple automation using → n8n + Vapi AI. Here’s how it works: → A customer calls your business number → Vapi AI picks up and talks to them like a real person → It asks for their name, what they need, and when they’re free → n8n takes that info and instantly books it in your calendar → Then it sends a confirmation text or email No voicemails. No chasing callbacks. No juggling schedules. It just works. And it saves hours every week. More importantly— It stops the revenue leak most businesses don’t even notice. If you're running or helping a service business, this kind of automation is a no-brainer. Watch the 2-minute demo. Then go build it or message me and I’ll show you how.
